# Python

Skeleton project for Python.

## Usage
- `./script/setup` to install dependencies (uses [homebrew](https://brew.sh/))
- `./script/test` to run the tests


## Structure
- Code located in [`pairing_exercise.py`](./pairing_exercise.py)
- Tests located in [`test_pairing_exercise.py`](./test_pairing_exercise.py)

However, you're free to organise your code as you like.
