# GO

Skeleton project for Go.

## Usage
- `./script/setup` to install dependencies
- `./script/test` to run the tests
- `./script/start` to run the code

## Structure
- Code located in [`pairing.go`](./src/pairing.go) and [`main.go`](main.go)
- Tests located in [`pairing_test.go`](./src/pairing_test.go)

However, you're free to organise your code as you like.
