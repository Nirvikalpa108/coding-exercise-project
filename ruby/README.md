# Pairing Test Skeleton

Pairing test starter project for Ruby. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/pairing_test` and put your specs in `spec/pairing_test_spec` (thes tests use rspec but feel free to `bundle install` anything else). To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt or `bin/script` if you want to type anything into a file and run it with some logging.

`lib` has been added to the `require` path so all imports inside the `lib` directory must be relative to this, e.g. `require "pairing_test/version"`.

## Local usage

To the developer: if you have never used Ruby on your mac you may need to install [bundler](https://bundler.io/) simply by running `gem install bundler`.

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.
