# Scala

Skeleton project for Scala.

## Usage
- `./script/setup` to install dependencies
- `./script/test` to run the tests

## Structure
- Code located in [`Main.scala`](./src/main/scala/gu/com/Main.scala)
- Tests located in [`MainTest.scala`](./src/test/scala/gu/com/MainTest.scala)

However, you're free to organise your code as you like.
